    question: 'What should I expect during the service?',
    answer: `Our Sunday Worship Service is a warm, Spirit-filled gathering that typically lasts about two hours. You can expect:

• **Worship & Praise** (30–40 min) — Our choir and worship team lead anointed praise and worship that ushers you into God's presence.
• **Prayer** — We take time to pray corporately and personally, believing God hears and answers.
• **The Word** — Our pastor delivers a clear, powerful, and practical message from the Bible.
• **Altar Call** — An invitation for salvation, healing, or rededication is given.
• **Fellowship** — After the service, we love to connect, share a meal, and pray for one another.

We are a joyful and welcoming congregation. Expect warmth, love, and a genuine encounter with God.`,
  },
  {
    id: 'parking',
    icon: <Car className="w-5 h-5 text-royal-600" />,
    question: 'Is there parking available?',
    answer: `Yes! We have parking available at the church premises and nearby areas for your convenience.

• **On-site Parking** — Limited spaces are available in our church compound (first come, first served).
• **Street Parking** — Ample street parking is available around the church.
• **Arrival Tip** — We recommend arriving 10–15 minutes early, especially on special service days, to find a comfortable parking spot and settle in.

Our ushers will be happy to guide you from the parking area to the church entrance.`,
  },
  {
    id: 'dress-code',
    icon: <Shirt className="w-5 h-5 text-royal-600" />,
    question: 'What should I wear?',
    answer: `At Judah Asher Ministries, we believe you should **come as you are**. There is no strict dress code — what matters most is your heart, not your outfit.

Most of our congregation dresses in smart-casual to semi-formal attire:

• **Smart-casual** — jeans, nice tops, kurtas, or casual dresses are perfectly fine.
• **Traditional wear** — sarees, salwars, or traditional outfits are warmly welcomed.
• **Formal/Sunday Best** — If you prefer to dress up, you're absolutely welcome to!

We want you to feel comfortable and free to worship without any pressure. God looks at the heart.`,
  },
  {
    id: 'children',
    icon: <Baby className="w-5 h-5 text-royal-600" />,
    question: "Is there Sunday School or Children's Ministry?",
    answer: `Absolutely! We love children and have a dedicated Children's Ministry just for them.

• **Children's Church** runs simultaneously with the main service for ages 3–12 years.
• **Age-appropriate Bible lessons**, worship, interactive activities, and games.
• **Safe, loving environment** — all our children's workers are vetted, trained, and passionate about kids.
• **Nursery care** is available for infants and toddlers (ages 0–2) so parents can worship freely.
• **Teens & Youth** are welcome to stay in the main service or join our Youth Fellowship.

Simply bring your children to the children's welcome desk when you arrive — our team will lovingly take care of them!`,
  },
  {
    id: 'service-length',
    icon: <Timer className="w-5 h-5 text-royal-600" />,
    question: 'How long is the service?',
    answer: `Our **Sunday Worship Service** runs from **11:00 AM to approximately 1:00 PM** — about two hours in total.

• **Saturday Prayer Service** runs from **6:00 PM to 8:00 PM**.
• Services can occasionally run a little longer during special events or revival meetings — but you're always free to stay or go as needed, no pressure!

We encourage you to stay for the full service to receive all that God has for you. After the service, many members enjoy fellowship and prayer in a relaxed environment — you're warmly invited to stay and connect.`,
  },
  {
    id: 'contact-before',
    icon: <Phone className="w-5 h-5 text-royal-600" />,
    question: 'How can I contact someone before visiting?',
    answer: `We'd love to hear from you before your first visit! Here's how you can reach us:

• **Phone/WhatsApp** — Call or message us at ${CHURCH_INFO.contact.phone1} or ${CHURCH_INFO.contact.phone2}
• **Email** — Write to us at ${CHURCH_INFO.contact.email}

  {
    id: 'first-time',
    icon: <Heart className="w-5 h-5 text-royal-600" />,
    question: 'What happens when I arrive for the first time?',
    answer: `Welcome! As a first-time visitor, you will feel warmly received from the moment you step in.

• **Greeters & Ushers** will welcome you at the entrance and help you find your seat.
• **Welcome Desk** — Look for our clearly marked welcome desk where our hospitality team will greet you, give you a welcome card, and answer any questions.
• **Seating** — We will guide you to comfortable seating. Feel free to sit anywhere you like.
• **Children's Check-in** — Our team will help you register your children for Children's Church.
• **No pressure** — You won't be asked to speak, introduce yourself publicly, or give an offering as a first-time guest. Just come and receive!

After the service, our pastor and leadership team make time to greet visitors personally. We truly look forward to meeting you!`,
  },
  {
    id: 'giving',
    icon: <CheckCircle className="w-5 h-5 text-royal-600" />,
    question: 'Is there an offering? Am I expected to give?',
    answer: `As a visitor, you are never expected or obligated to give. The offering is for members who wish to participate in the ministry of the church.

We take an offering during the service as part of our worship and obedience to God's Word. Giving bags or plates will be passed around, but visitors can simply let them pass by — there is absolutely no pressure.

If you later feel led to give and support the ministry, you can do so through the offering bag during service, at the welcome desk, or by asking our team about bank transfer details. We are grateful for every gift given from the heart!`,
